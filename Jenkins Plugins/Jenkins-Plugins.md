# Jenkins Plugins

## What Are Jenkins Plugins?

Jenkins plugins are modular components that extend the core functionality of Jenkins. They allow Jenkins to integrate with tools, add new features, or customize behavior — making Jenkins highly flexible and adaptable for different DevOps and CI/CD needs.

##  Why Plugins Matter

Jenkins is designed to be minimal by default.

Plugins are how you add support for:

- **Source control** (like Git, GitHub, Bitbucket)  
- **Build tools** (like Maven, Gradle, Ant)  
- **Deployment** (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)  
- **Notifications** (Slack, email)  
- **Test reporting**, code analysis, UI themes, and much more

##  Things to Keep in Mind

- Too many plugins can slow Jenkins down and increase the risk of conflicts.
- Always check **compatibility** with your Jenkins version before installing.
- Regularly **update plugins** to get bug fixes and security patches.
- Some plugins are no longer maintained — avoid outdated or deprecated ones.
