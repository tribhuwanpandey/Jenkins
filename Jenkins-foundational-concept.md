#  Jenkins Foundational Concepts

---

##  1. Jenkins Jobs (Projects)

| Job Type             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Freestyle**        | Simple UI-configured job. Good for basic automation tasks. |
| **Pipeline**         | Code-defined workflow using a `Jenkinsfile`. Supports advanced CI/CD. |
| **Multibranch Pipeline** | Automatically creates jobs for each branch. |
| **Folder**           | Organize related jobs into groups. |

---

##  2. Source Code Management (SCM)

Jenkins integrates with version control systems like:

- Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket  
- Subversion (SVN)  

Used to **pull source code** for builds.

---

##  3. Build Triggers

| Trigger Type        | Use Case |
|---------------------|----------|
| **SCM Polling**      | Check for code changes at intervals. |
| **Webhook**          | Triggered by external services (e.g., GitHub push). |
| **Manual**           | Triggered by a user click. |
| **Scheduled (CRON)** | Build at specific times (e.g., nightly). |

---

##  4. Build Steps

Actions Jenkins performs during a job:

- Run shell or batch scripts  
- Compile code (Maven, Gradle)  
- Run tests (JUnit, pytest)  
- Build Docker images  

---

##  5. Post-Build Actions

Tasks performed **after** the main build:

- Send emails or Slack notifications  
- Archive build artifacts  
- Trigger another job  
- Publish test/coverage reports  

---

##  6. Plugins

Jenkins is **plugin-based**. Common plugins include:

- Git  
- Docker  
- Email Extension  
- JUnit  
- Slack, JIRA, SonarQube integrations  

---

##  7. Jenkinsfile

Defines a **Pipeline as code** using Groovy syntax.

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building...'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Testing...'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        echo 'Deploying...'
      }
    }
  }
}

```


##  8. Artifacts

Files generated by builds that are stored for later use.

- **Examples:** `.jar`, `.war`, logs, reports  
- Can be **archived** and **downloaded** for future use.

---

##  9. Nodes (Agents)

| Component              | Role                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Controller (Master)** | Schedules jobs and manages configuration |
| **Agent (Node)**        | Executes jobs (can be local or remote)    |

---

##  10. Security & Users

- **Authentication:** LDAP, local users, or OAuth  
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Controls who can **configure**, **build**, and **view** jobs.
